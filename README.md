This QR Code Generator is a Python application that generates QR codes from text or links with a user-friendly interface.
Certainly! Here's an example of a README file for the QR Code Generator project:

# QR Code Generator

The QR Code Generator is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to generate QR codes from text or links. The application is built using Python and the tkinter library for creating the GUI, along with the qrcode library for generating QR codes.

## Features

- Input text or link: Users can enter the desired text or link for which they want to generate a QR code.
- Generate QR Code: With a click of a button, the application generates a QR code based on the input text or link.
- Display QR Code: The generated QR code is displayed within the application's GUI.
- Print QR Code: Users can save the generated QR code as a PNG image file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library
- qrcode library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install qrcode Pillow
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script `qrcode_generator.py` using Python:
   ```
   python qrcode_generator.py
   ```

2. The application window will open.
3. Enter the desired text or link into the text entry field.
4. Click on the "Generate QR Code" button to generate the QR code.
5. The generated QR code will be displayed in the application window.
6. To save the QR code as a PNG image file, click on the "Print QR Code" button. Choose a location on your computer to save the image.

## Customization

- Logo: You can replace the default logo image by following the instructions in the code comments of the `generate_qr_code` method. Ensure that the new logo image is compatible and suitable for QR codes.
- GUI Styling: If you want to customize the GUI appearance, you can modify the code related to fonts, colors, and window dimensions in the `QRCodeGenerator` class.

## Acknowledgments

- The project utilizes the `qrcode` library, which is an open-source library for generating QR codes.
- The GUI is built using the `tkinter` library, a standard GUI toolkit for Python.

Feel free to modify and enhance the project according to your needs. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!

For detailed information and usage instructions, please refer to the code comments.

Enjoy generating QR codes with the QR Code Generator!
